# Graphs
Project for Algorithms and Data Structures. Defining given graph parameters

1 - the degree sequence;
2 - the number of components;
3 - bipartiteness;
4 - the eccentricity of vertices (within the components)
5 - planarity;
6 - vertices colours (consecutive natural numbers from 1) obtained using algorithms:
  6a - greedy (the vertex order according to its number)
  6b - LF method (ties are solved by the vertex number)
  6c - SLF method (ties are solved by highest vertex degree, and if there is still a tie choose the vertex with the lowest number)
7 - the number of different C4 subgraphs
8 - the number of the graph complement's edges
